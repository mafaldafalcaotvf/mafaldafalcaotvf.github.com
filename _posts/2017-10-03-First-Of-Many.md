Hello, stranger! This is my newest blog! 

Now that I finished my Masters and I am going to start to work as a junior researcher, I thought that maybe - *just maybe...* - I could share all my new discoveries on my new stage of life. I'm not sure about what I will write... I will right about some techninal and specific topics that I am going to deal with. But, who knows, I can share a little more of another things that I do... I will only promise that I will try to keep this updated! 

P.S.: Also, feel free to use my Jekyll's theme :)

*XOXO,*

*Mafalda*
